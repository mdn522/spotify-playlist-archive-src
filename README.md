# spotify-playlist-archive-src

This repository contains the source code for
[mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive-src](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive-src).

I split it out because the original repo is so large that it makes local
development difficult. With a separate repo, I can work on the source code
without the burden of the playlist data.
